# Responsive-Portfolio

After doing the bootstrap portfolio, I found it more challenging to transition to doing media queries.

I struggled with centering the nav links in the static header for the smallest media query.

For the portfolio page, I re-created it and its accompanying css styles multiple times (based on the recommended HW solution from week 1), worked with a few TAs (which I got the pics to respond but not nicely without 'breaking' the other pages- sigh), and am oh-so-close to getting the pictures and their headings to better resize and position; I have more ideas. I hope it's just a minor oversight and welcome the insights -- please! -- though I think I will do yet another redo of the alignment for all medias to make this work. I'm a perfectionist and stubbornly determined to get it working.

This activity definitely reinforced my HTML/CSS knowledge and pushed me to learn  about dissecting code to resolve issues (and to practice patience and to know when to ask for help).
