# Responsive-Portfolio

After doing the bootstrap portfolio, I found it more challenging to transition to doing media queries.

I struggled with centering the nav links in the static header for the smallest media query.

For the portfolio page, I re-created it and its accompanying css styles multiple times (based on the recommended HW solution from week 1) and still am having difficulty with the pictures and their heading resizing and positioning correctly. I hope it's just a minor oversight and welcome the insights -- please! -- to make this work.

This activity definitely reinforced my HTML/CSS knowledge but also frustrated me when the resizing would not respond as expected.
