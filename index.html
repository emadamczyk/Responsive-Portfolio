                    <p>I am a bike commuter and bike safety advocate in Chicago. In 2012 I earned certification as a cycling instructor through the League of American Bicyclists, and I teach bike lessons and collaborate with local, state, and national bicycle organizations that support the rights of bicyclists.</p>
                    <p>Along my bicycling journeys, I often take photos of scenery. Over the years I have produced calendars highlighting my photos of bicycles, city scapes, and flowers. All proceeds from the sales of the calendars benefited the Ride of Silence organization which honors cyclists who have been injured or killed while riding on public roadways and raises awareness that cyclists have a right to share the road.</p>
